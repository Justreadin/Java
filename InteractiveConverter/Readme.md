- InteractiveConverter

- InteractiveConverter is a simple Java console application that provides interactive utilities for:

1. Converting a number to a string and back to a number.
2. Reversing a given string.
3. This application loops through a menu until the user decides to exit, making it easy to repeatedly convert or reverse inputs without restarting the program.

- Features
1. Convert Number to String and Back: Allows users to enter a number, which is then converted to a string and back to a number, displaying each step in the console.

2. Reverse a String: Takes a string from the user and displays the reversed version.
User-Friendly Loop: After each operation, the program returns to the main menu until the user chooses to exit.
