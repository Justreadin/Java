- Organization Management System
* An example project designed to demonstrate object-oriented principles in Java, using packages to separate classes, interfaces, and abstract classes for better organization and scalability. This project models a simple organization system, including entities like employees, departments, projects, clients, and tasks.

- The Organization Management System is a basic Java application that organizes classes, interfaces, and abstract classes into dedicated packages. The goal is to simulate a structured system in which entities interact through services and abstract bases. Each package encapsulates a part of the project's functionality, demonstrating modularity and maintainability.

- Features
- 1. Modular Structure: The code is organized into separate packages for models, services, and base (abstract) classes.
Object-Oriented Design: Uses classes, interfaces, and abstract classes to model real-world entities and their relationships.
- 2.Easy to Extend: Additional entities, methods, or features can be added without disrupting existing code.

- Project Structure
The project follows a three-package structure for clarity and organization:

- Package Details

  
- 1. Git_packages - Contains the main classes that represent entities in the system.

- Employee: Represents an employee with properties like name and employeeId.
- Department: Represents a department with departmentName and departmentCode.
- Project: Represents a project with projectName and budget.
- Client: Represents a client with clientName and clientAddress.
- Task: Represents a task with taskDescription and taskId.


- 2. Git_interfaces - Contains interfaces that define operations related to each entity.

- IEmployeeService: Defines methods to add, remove, and get employees.
- IDepartmentService: Defines methods to manage departments.
- IProjectService: Defines methods to manage projects.
- IClientService: Defines methods to manage clients.
- ITaskService: Defines methods to manage tasks.

  
- 2. Abtract_packages - Contains abstract classes that define base properties and methods.

- EmployeeBase: Abstract class with base properties and methods for employees.
- DepartmentBase: Abstract class with base properties and methods for departments.
- ProjectBase: Abstract class with base properties and methods for projects.
- ClientBase: Abstract class with base properties and methods for clients.
- TaskBase: Abstract class with base properties and methods for tasks.

  
- Getting Started
  
Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher: This project is written in Java and requires a JDK to compile and run.

- Installation
Clone the Repository

- .git clone https://github.com/justreadin/java/Java_package.git

- .cd Java_package

- .Open in IDE: Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to explore and execute.

- Build the Project:

Use javac for command-line compilation.
Or, use the IDE's build tool to compile.
- Usage
To see how the system works, you can create instances of Employee, Department, Project, Client, and Task and interact with them through the interfaces.

- Example
package Java_package;

import Java_packages.Git_packages.Employee;
import Java_package.Git_packages.Department;
import Java_package.Git_interfaces.IEmployeeService;
import Java_package.Git_interfaces.IDepartmentService;
import Java_package.Abstract_classes.EmployeeBase;

// Main class to demonstrate usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example of creating and using Employee objects
        Employee employee = new Employee("Alice", 1001);
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + employee.getName());
        System.out.println("Employee ID: " + employee.getEmployeeId());

        // Example of creating and using Department objects
        Department department = new Department("IT", 10);
        System.out.println("Department Name: " + department.getDepartmentName());
        System.out.println("Department Code: " + department.getDepartmentCode());

       Further operations could include implementing service interfaces to add, remove, or fetch entities
    }
}


- Notes:
- .This example demonstrates how to initialize objects and access their properties through getters. Further usage can include implementing the interfaces in service classes to perform CRUD operations.
